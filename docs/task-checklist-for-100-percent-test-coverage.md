## Notes

- Keep test files organized according to the BDD pattern
- Use mocks consistently for external dependencies
- Update this checklist regularly as tasks are completed
- Focus on high-priority components first
- When blocked on one component, switch to another rather than stopping progress
- Record any patterns or common issues in the troubleshooting section of the main documentation
