```

### 4. JWT Authentication

**Testing:**
```bash
# Test token generation
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"master_password":"your_master_password"}' \
  http://localhost:8081/api/auth/token

# Test protected endpoint without token
curl -v http://localhost:8081/api/links
# Should return 401 Unauthorized

# Test protected endpoint with token
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8081/api/links
# Should return 200 OK

# Test expired token
# (Wait for expiration or use a token with past expiration)
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <expired_token>" http://localhost:8081/api/links
# Should return 401 Unauthorized
```
